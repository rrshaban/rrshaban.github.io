    <p>Long story short: a group of students got together and built something pretty awesome, the <a href="https://www.swatcoursereview.com/">Swarthmore Course Review</a>, or SwatCoRe for short.</p>

<p>If you’re curious, check out some <a href="https://www.swatcoursereview.com/help">FAQs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="what-is-swatcore">What is SwatCoRe?</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>SwatCoRe is a student-led initiative to try to make course information more easily accessible to students. Anyone can review a course, upload a syllabus (look for the  icon), and vote for helpful reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="isnt-this-the-same-as-ratemyprofessor">Isn’t this the same as RateMyProfessor?</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, kind of. SwatCoRe is more course- than professor-focused, though, as professors may have certain strengths and weaknesses. Also SwatCoRe is locally focused, we hope to build a community of peer reviewers that is more focused on Swarthmore. Have you tried looking for a Swat professor on RMP? Good luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="who-can-see-my-reviews">Who can see my reviews?</h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone with a TriCo (@swarthmore, @haverford, or @brynmawr) email address can sign up for SwatCoRe. As our intention is to benefit the Swarthmore community, we have no intention of publicizing these reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I took a pretty strong stance on requiring users to verify their identities via a school-hosted email address because I didn’t want SwatCoRe to turn into a negative community (à la Yik Yak). SwatCoRe users can pick whatever community-facing name they want (only logged-in users, community members, can view reviews), but ultimately site admins will know who is responsible for any content.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we haven’t had any issues with content at all so far. At the time of writing, there have been 230 reviews posted and not a single one of them has been rated overall unhelpful (208 helpful reviews!). We publish <a href="https://www.swatcoursereview.com/stats">live statistics</a> so that it’s easy to see just how many people are being helped by your review (~350 users within a month after soft launch).</p>

<p>The code being deployed is viewable on <a href="https://github.com/rrshaban/swatcore-dev">GitHub</a>. We use Heroku to auto-deploy from a production branch, so what you see is what you get (and it’s super-easy to modify and extend, if you want to fork it).</p>

<p>I have so much to say about SwatCoRe, a labor of love long pursued, but I hope to take my hands off and watch a community grow. We believe that SwatCoRe will grow to become a real resource for the Swarthmore student body.</p>
