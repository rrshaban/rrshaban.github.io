One cool trick I learned is that GitHub automatically recognizes and renders JSON map fields using MapBox. I discovered this by accident when I tried to upload a comparison of [the GPX file output by Runkeeper](https://gist.github.com/rrshaban/d87f9d8bdbea419af691) and [the JSON output of toGeoJSON](https://gist.github.com/rrshaban/e44e0bc6b8d136a4c613), an open-source tool built by Mapbox (which has [25 pages](https://github.com/mapbox) of repos on GitHub). GitHub automatically displays the JSON blob as a map, rendered via MapBox, while providing an option to display [the source blob](https://gist.github.com/rrshaban/e44e0bc6b8d136a4c613?short_path=036faa2) as well.
