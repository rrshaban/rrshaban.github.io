We stand at the edge of a dive into the Internet of Things, where all devices speak the language of data. One of the most interesting applications of this technology is tracking our own bodies to learn exactly,  how we're doing. 

I like working with data; by profession, I'm a data scientist. My interests with data surround how to organize and present its structure, my guilty pleasures are maps and graphs. So when I found out that Runkeeper could map my runs and produce detailed graphs, I couldn't help but try it out. 

My first half marathon, as organized by Runkeeper. 

Here's now my training regimen, as organized and presented by Runkeeper. 

And my first run after the marathon (with a lovely correlation between incline and pace). 

Having almost real-time data about my runs kept me honest and supported me when I was doubting that work worked. For someone who has never run before, this kind of visualization makes the struggle more easily appreciated; it makes tangible my efforts. 

I think people will like this, and they will like it a lot. The competitive aspect of people pushing their bodies is already starting to be realized (running stat website and flywheel), but the dangers of that kind of attitude carried out without restraint is also clear (CrossFit). 

But training with data means easy accessibility to information about your body and its performance. Who isn't going to want to know about a [] [], or an irregular heartbeat? Google is already developing contact lenses for detecting glucose levels via contact lenses. Once that Avenue is developed, we might be able to track all kinds of data about ourselves: vitamin and hormone levels, heartbeat data [ redundant], and. The technology will take a while to develop and will likely remain a Palo Alto novelty for many years, but once it becomes more affordably accessible, it will skyrocket in popularity, and we should be thinking about how to organize and present health data well.
