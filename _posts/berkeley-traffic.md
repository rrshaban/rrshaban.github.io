On the organization of traffic in Berkeley

recursive, hierarchical ordering of all traffic coming into Berkeley.

{top_level_satellite}

Most long-distance traffic to Berkeley comes via [I-80](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Interstate_80), which serves as a spine of traffic to Berkeley. I-80 is located right off the water and we will see soon why it is a central point of access to Berkeley, via Exit 11 (and the Berkeley Amtrak, which runs inland parallel to the highway). From most parts of Oakland, to the south, and Richmond, to the north, it is faster and more convenient to catch I-80 into Berkeley. 

{bay_ecosystem}

This spine is very neatly organized by type of traffic. Five lanes of open highway (Eastshore Freeway) on each side allow for cars, trucks, and buses to easily cover distance without interference. Two small two-lane roads on either side of the freeway (West Frontage Road, on the water side, and Eastshore Highway, on the land side) allow for easy vehicular access to and from the freeway. On the outside of the water-side access road is the San Francisco Bay Trail, a two-lane bicycle highway with a pedestrian walkway. Separating these means of commute from the water is the [Eastshore State Park](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eastshore_State_Park), which is [8.5 miles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/EastshoreSPmap.png) of park and wildlife refuge spanning natural and restored wetlands.

Every type of traffic has its own zone, making it easy to get to Berkeley. Of course, to actually get into Berkeley, these zones will have to turn, forcing intersection. For the two general classes of traffic, vehicular and non-vehicular, there are two separate bridges. Cars and trucks take [Exit 11](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Interstate_80_in_California#/Exit_list) to the access roads, which exit to University Ave, and the non-vehicular Bay Trail has a nearby dedicated bridge. Note that when the access road needs more space for the ramps up to the freeway, the Bay Trail widens out to preserve the hierarchical ordering of traffic; this allows for only one intersection between different classes of traffic for the entire exit system. All other interactions between different classes of traffic are merges, which means traffic is slowed as little as possible. This also means that different modes of transit do not come into contact often, allowing bikers, drivers, and pedestrians all the comfort to settle into personal means of transit. 

{bridges_sat_wide}

From this exit, two separate paths lead inland to Berkeley. One of these is University Ave, a car-dominant four-lane avenue with a divider, and the other is a continuation of the San Francisco Bay Trail down alongside [Berkeley Aquatic Park](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aquatic_Park_(Berkeley)). <!-- I am beginning to distinguish here between mixed-use streets that nonetheless prioritize different modes of travel, this distinction between preferring vehicular and preferring non-vehicular transit will permeate much of the following exploration. --> Both Addison and University cross the Amtrak/Caltrain <!-- (which?? name of crossing, maybe mention Berkeley stop) --> rails, which are separated from the main freeway by two city blocks; however, University crosses the rails by bridge <!-- (which bridge??) --> and Addison crosses the tracks directly <!-- ehh phrasing -->. 

{exit_university} {exit_addison}

These two paths are a block apart, but we will see that they do not intersect but rather feed into two separate, overlapping systems of road. While both roads seem to feed into the general street system, there is an ordering of the streets to keep the different types of traffic as separate as possible while allowing both direct access to every block in Berkeley. Here's how Google renders these two systems:

{bike_lanes_google}

We can see that some of the roads leading off the Bay Trail are highlighted by Google with dotted or solid green lines as "bicycle-friendly roads." University Ave is distinctly avoided: we will see which traffic management policies make University car-dominant and which make others bike-dominant. We can note first that the Bay Trail and University Ave intersect, on the far side of I-80; in this intersection, traffic policies make bikes dominant. <!-- expand on this -->

{intersection_bay_and_university}

Bay Trail intersection with University Ave is bike-dominant.
