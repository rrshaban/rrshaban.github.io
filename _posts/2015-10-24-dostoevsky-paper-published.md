I got a bit of a blast from the past this week when I received a copy of [*The Birch*](http://slavic.columbia.edu/department-journals/birch) Spring 2015, which contains [an essay](http://issuu.com/thebirchjournal/docs/birchspring2015) I wrote in the fall of 2012. 

Nabokov dismissed Dostoevsky's *Crime and Punishment* for its redemption scene ("the crack" in the novel), in which Sonya, forced into prostitution, reads the Bible to Raskolnikov, Dostoevsky's madman-murderer-protagonist. Reduced to that, the section is pretty cliché (even then), and Nabokov describes it as "long-winded, terribly sentimental, and badly written." 

I figured I couldn't miss an opportunity to defend one of my favorite novels, so I did [a close reading (p. 50)](http://issuu.com/thebirchjournal/docs/birchspring2015) of the chapter. I was particularly enamoured of Bakhtin's [polyphonic theory](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Bakhtin-MainTheory.html) at the time, so I pulled apart the various discourses juxtaposed by Dostoevsky and – well, if you're still reading, you might as well just read it yourself.
