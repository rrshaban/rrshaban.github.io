So, where to begin ? 
I recently (at the beginning of this year) designed a multi-lingual website as a chapter of discovery surrounding my AlphaBet research project â€“Â

An exploration of ChatGPT's cross-linguistic abilities, disguised as a font-exploration project. 

This led to me unpacking a long-interesting language-family relationship; that between Arabic and Mongolian (mediated, in this case, by [Sogdian](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxkcKc0CDzGnOwiAFtkB61T2fSUwabnlgmSIbl8vP9Y/edit?usp=sharing) [mediated in the sense of curiosity â€“Â I don't remember the ethno-linguistic history]). 

I started to create a personal website, inspired by some of the RTL and vertical CSS_magic I was discovering. Unfortunately in this screenshot the Mongolian cursive is broken (a familiar experience to Arabic-speakers) .. but it shows some of what I was aspiring to create:

Naturally, I hosted it and found that the website that was hosting totally butchered the Unicode, performing a very strange (and actually very interesting) transmutation :

As I had just travelled through Iceland, England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain, I was intrigued to see such a wide spectrum of Latin-variety characters. As someone who's long been fascinated with languages... where to begin! 

What an interesting rainbow of language.
